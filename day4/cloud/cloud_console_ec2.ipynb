    "\n",
    "    - Compute can start as soon as you want it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You do not purchase and maintain hardware, operating systems etcetera\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Upgrades just happen\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You pay for resources you use; and then shut them off\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You don’t have to buy into an institutional cluster if the cost calculation doesn’t make sense for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You have huge scale-up potential (reduced processing time)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In principle, you have near-infinite computing capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. There is a huge support community rapidly expanding cloud tools and tech\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Because of the public availability of these resources, and substantial buy-in from industry, there is a large eco-system of tools and resources.\n",
